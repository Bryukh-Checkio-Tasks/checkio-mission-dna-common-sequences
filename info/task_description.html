    Deoxyribonucleic acid is a molecule that encodes
    the genetic instructions used in the development and functioning of all known living organisms and many viruses.
    A DNA molecule consists of two strands that wrap around each other to resemble a twisted ladder whose sides, made of
    sugar and phosphate molecules, are connected by rungs of nitrogen-containing chemicals called bases.
    Each strand is a linear arrangement of repeating similar units called nucleotides.
    Each nucleotide is composed of a nitrogen-containing nucleobaseâ€”either
    guanine (G), adenine (A), thymine (T), or cytosine (C).
    The particular order of the bases arranged along the sugar-phosphate backbone is called the DNA
    sequence; the sequence specifies the exact genetic instructions required to create a particular organism with its
    own unique traits.

        We want compare DNA strands and find the longest common base sequence in the two
    strands. These strands can be represented as strings consisting of the letters "ACGT".
    For example the longest common sequence for strands "ACGTC" and "TTCGT" is "CGT".
</p>

<p>
    You are given two strand descriptions and you should find the longest common sequence.
    If we have several various longest sequences with the same length, then return them as
    a string where these sequence are written in <strong>lexicographical order</strong> separated by commas.
    For example, for "CGCTA" and "TACCG" we found two sequnces "CG" and "TA", so the result is
    "CG,TA". If the given sequences don't have a common sequence then return an empty string.

<p>
    <strong>Input: </strong> Two arguments. Base sequences as strings.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Output: </strong> The common longest sequence or sequences as a string.

    <strong>How it is used: </strong>
    Bioinformatic scientists are using programm skills to examine DNA sequences.
    With this concept you can create an useful tool for this.
